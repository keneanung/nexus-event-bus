During testing, people noticed that the Web API for generating cryptographically secure random numbers are not available and thus the UUID package we depend on was unable to load.\\n\\nA proper polyfill is curently impossible as we can not ship Java modules in Nexus packages. Luckily, the UUID package allows to supply a custom function for generating the required random values. As a workaround, this functionality was used in connection with Math.random to supply the needed information.\\n\\nThat means however, that our UUIDs are not as random as they usually are. But for our use case of generating random names, this should be good enough."},{"id":"/2022/04/27/_Khaseems_Wishlist","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-event-bus/blog/2022/04/27/_Khaseems_Wishlist","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-event-bus/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2022-04-27_Khaseems_Wishlist.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-27_Khaseems_Wishlist.md","title":"Khaseems Wishlist: v0.1.1","description":"This release is something, the Achaean Player Khaseem wished for.

He\'s been using the original EventStream module of NexSys very extenively. However, he\'d like to move to an external package to help the adoption of a standard set of Nexus packages.\\n\\nThe original EventStream had a set of features that were part of his development flow: The ability to unsubscribe from events using a function name and access to the list of subscribers to an event.\\n\\nWhile the former is about a preferred coding style, the latter is useful for debugging code: That way you can easily have a look at the list of subscribers to an event and determine if all subscribers actually belong there at this point.\\n\\n## New Features\\n\\nYou may now subscribe or unsubscribe to events using a callback function name instead of a function reference. To avoid accidental overwriting of existing callbacks, especially between different users of the EventBus, duplicate subscription names generate an error. So you may want to namespace your event names.\\n\\nYou can now access the list of subscribers to an event using the `getSubscribers` method. This allows easy inspection of the subscription state of callbacks. The subscribers may not be changed this way."},{"id":"/2022/04/11/_Initial_Release","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-event-bus/blog/2022/04/11/_Initial_Release","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-event-bus/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2022-04-11_Initial_Release.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-11_Initial_Release.md","title":"Initial Release v0.0.3","description":"Hello World!","date":"2022-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 11, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":0.99,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"keneanung","url":"https://github.com/keneanung","email":"keneanung@gmail.com","key":"keneanung"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"keneanung"},"prevItem":{"title":"Khaseems Wishlist: v0.1.1","permalink":"/nexus-event-bus/blog/2022/04/27/_Khaseems_Wishlist"}},"content":"`Hello World!`\\n\\nAnd with that out of the way, I present the first release on my event bus package for the Nexus MUD client.\\n\\nWhile there are already implementations of the event bus for the Nexus MUD client (ie as part of the NexSys and NexGUI projects), I wanted to make a package that is not part of a larger project. Instead this project can be installed individually and be used as a dependency for other projects. This should make it easier for the community to adapt a set of lightweight standard packages that still allow the users a large amount of flexibility to use the packages they like.\\n\\nThis release is the minimal viable product and contains the most basic functionality: Registering event handlers, raising events and unregistering event handlers. The [API documentation](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-event-bus/docs/api) has all the gritty details.\\n\\nMore features may be added in the future. Feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-event-bus/issues/new) to discuss further extnsions.\\n\\nIf you like my work and want to support me, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung).\\n\\nOh, and why is the initial release version `0.0.3`?
