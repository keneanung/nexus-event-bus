Instead this project can be installed individually and be used as a dependency for other projects. This should make it easier for the community to adapt a set of lightweight standard packages that still allow the users a large amount of flexibility to use the packages they like.\\n\\nThis release is the minimal viable product and contains the most basic functionality: Registering event handlers, raising events and unregistering event handlers. The [API documentation](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-event-bus/docs/api) has all the gritty details.\\n\\nMore features may be added in the future. Feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-event-bus/issues/new) to discuss further extnsions.\\n\\nIf you like my work and want to support me, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung).\\n\\nOh, and why is the initial release version `0.0.3`? Well, I messed up the packaging, so I had to redo it a few times. I\'m sorry."}]}')}}]);
